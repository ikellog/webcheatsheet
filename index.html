        </tr>

          <td>&lt;main&gt;</td>
          <td><p>is for content unique to this page.
                 Use &lt;main&gt; only once per page, and put it directly inside &lt;body&gt.
                 Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.</p></td>

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;article&gt;</td>
          <td><p>encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the 
                 rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post)..</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;section&gt;</td>
          <td><p>is similar to &lt;article&gt, but it is more for grouping together a single part of 
                 the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or 
                 a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered best practice 
                 to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break &lt;article&gt;s up into 
                 different &lt;section&gt;s, or &lt;sectiom&gt;s up into different &lt;article&gt;s, depending on the context.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

                 information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.)..</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;header&gt;</td>
          <td><p>represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of &lt;body&gt; it defines the global header 
                 of a webpage, but if it's a child of an &lt;article&gt; or &lt;section&gt; it defines a specific header for that 
                 section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).</p></td>

          <td>creates a line break in a paragraph; it is the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation where you 
              want a series of fixed short lines, such as in a postal address or a poem.</td>

          <td>elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text 
              (such as a change in topic or scene). Visually it just looks like a horizontal line.</td>
